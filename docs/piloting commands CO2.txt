$CO_PUMP: 
0: Do not change the pump status
1: Turn the pump off after zeroing. This is used at the end of the mission in order to turn off the pump in the last dive, just before recovering the glider so as to avoid running the pump in air.
$CO_ZERO:
0: Do not zero
1: Zero after the end of a dive (apogee)
2: Zero after the end of a climb (surface)
$CO_DATA:
0: No data
1: Get “Critical” data in the following order:
ds4.pCO2_corr
ds4.P_IN
ds4.runtime
ts4.T_gas
ts4.rH_gas
2: Get “Nice to have” data in following order:
ds4.pCO2_corr
ds4.P_IN
ds4.runtime
ds4.signal_raw
ds4.signal_ref
ts4.T_gas
ts4.rH_gas
3: Get “Ideal” data in following order:
ds4.P_IN
ds4.pCO2_corr
ds4.T_sensor
ds4.xCO2_corr	
ds4.runtime
ds4.date
ds4.time
ds4.signal_raw

error reporting:
P_in 1100 mbar max
%rH_gas  85% max
T_control must stay around +/- 0.5 degree of set temperature. (28°C)
P_pump 0.3-1.6 W, outside of this may indicate a problem.
